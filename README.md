### Data Cleaning and Preparations

For this dataset, I performed several key actions to ensure the data was ready for analysis:

- Removed duplicates to prevent overcounting.
- Handled missing values by either filling them in or removing incomplete records.
- Used the "Find and Replace" function to correct inconsistent data entries (e.g., formatting issues or typos).
- Standardized column names for consistency and readability.
- Converted data types (e.g., date and time formats) to ensure proper analysis.
- Filtered out any irrelevant data that did not contribute to the analysis.
