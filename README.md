### Project Overview

This project analyzes pizza sales data to understand how customers order, which pizza sizes they prefer, when the busiest times are, and how pricing affects sales. The insights from this analysis will help improve marketing, manage inventory more efficiently, and boost customer satisfaction.

### Data Sources  

The data for this analysis comes from the Pizza Sales.csv file, which was freely downloaded from Kaggle.com.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations

For this dataset, I performed several key actions to ensure the data was ready for analysis:

- Removed duplicates to prevent overcounting.
- Handled missing values by either filling them in or removing incomplete records.
- Used the "Find and Replace" function to correct inconsistent data entries (e.g., formatting issues or typos).
- Standardized column names for consistency and readability.
- Converted data types (e.g., date and time formats) to ensure proper analysis.
- Filtered out any irrelevant data that did not contribute to the analysis.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis

During the EDA, the data was explored to address the following key questions:

- Which pizza size is the most preferred by customers?
- Which pizza category (e.g., Classic, Chicken, Supreme) is the most popular?
- What day of the week sees the highest sales volume?
- What month records the most sales?
- At what time of day are the majority of pizza orders placed?
- Which specific pizza name is the most frequently ordered by customers?
